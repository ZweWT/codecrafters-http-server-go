# Research and Exploration Framework for Go HTTP Server Development

## Philosophy of Learning Through Exploration

As a backend engineer learning Go, exploring the language's internals and standard library implementations can provide deep insights that improve your own code. This framework guides productive research while maintaining focus on your current HTTP server implementation.

## Research Methodology

### 1. Question-Driven Exploration
Start every research session with a specific question:
- "How does Go's net/http package parse HTTP requests?"
- "What makes Go's goroutine scheduler efficient for network servers?"
- "How does the standard library handle connection pooling?"

### 2. Progressive Depth Levels
**Level 1: Documentation First**
- Read official Go documentation
- Study package examples
- Understand public APIs

**Level 2: Source Code Analysis**
- Examine standard library implementation
- Focus on relevant functions and types
- Understand design patterns used

**Level 3: Runtime Behavior**
- Use debugging tools (pprof, trace)
- Benchmark different approaches
- Observe memory and CPU usage

**Level 4: Language Internals**
- Study compiler output
- Understand memory layout
- Explore runtime implementation

## Structured Research Process

### Before You Start
1. **Define Learning Objective**: What specific knowledge will help your current implementation?
2. **Set Time Boundary**: Allocate specific time (15-30 minutes) for exploration
3. **Prepare Questions**: Write down 2-3 specific questions to answer

### During Research
1. **Take Notes**: Document key insights and patterns
2. **Code Examples**: Create small test programs to verify understanding
3. **Connect to Current Work**: Relate findings to your HTTP server implementation

### After Research
1. **Summarize Learnings**: Write a brief summary of key insights
2. **Action Items**: Identify specific improvements for your code
3. **Future Research**: Note interesting topics for later exploration

## Go Standard Library Deep Dives

### net/http Package Exploration

#### Core Components to Study
```go
// Key types to understand
type Request struct { ... }
type Response struct { ... }
type Handler interface { ... }
type ServeMux struct { ... }
```

#### Research Questions
- How does `http.ListenAndServe` work internally?
- What's the lifecycle of an HTTP request in the standard library?
- How does Go handle concurrent connections?
- What optimizations exist in the request parser?

#### Source Code Locations
```
src/net/http/
├── server.go          # Core server implementation
├── request.go         # Request parsing and handling
├── response.go        # Response writing
├── transport.go       # Client-side transport
└── h2_bundle.go       # HTTP/2 implementation
```

#### Exploration Exercises
1. **Request Parsing**: Study `readRequest` function in `server.go`
2. **Response Writing**: Examine `response.Write` method
3. **Connection Handling**: Trace through `conn.serve` method
4. **Error Handling**: Understand error propagation patterns

### net Package Deep Dive

#### Focus Areas
- TCP connection establishment
- Buffer management
- Deadline handling
- Connection pooling

#### Key Functions to Study
```go
func Listen(network, address string) (Listener, error)
func (l *TCPListener) Accept() (Conn, error)
func (c *conn) Read(b []byte) (int, error)
func (c *conn) Write(b []byte) (int, error)
```

### bufio Package Analysis

#### Understanding Buffered I/O
- How `bufio.Reader` optimizes reading
- Buffer sizing strategies
- When to use buffered vs unbuffered I/O

#### Key Methods
```go
func (b *Reader) ReadLine() (line []byte, isPrefix bool, err error)
func (b *Reader) ReadString(delim byte) (string, error)
func (b *Writer) Write(p []byte) (nn int, err error)
func (b *Writer) Flush() error
```

## Go Runtime Exploration

### Goroutine Scheduler Research

#### Understanding M:N Scheduling
- How goroutines map to OS threads
- Work stealing algorithm
- Context switching overhead

#### Research Tools
```bash
# Trace goroutine execution
go build -o server main.go
GODEBUG=schedtrace=1000 ./server

# Detailed runtime tracing
go build -o server main.go
./server &
go tool trace trace.out
```

#### Key Questions
- How many OS threads does your server create?
- What's the goroutine lifecycle for each HTTP connection?
- How does the scheduler handle blocking I/O operations?

### Memory Management Deep Dive

#### Stack vs Heap Allocation
```bash
# Analyze escape analysis
go build -gcflags="-m" main.go

# Profile memory usage
go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap
```

#### Research Areas
- When do variables escape to heap?
- How does the garbage collector affect server performance?
- Stack growth and shrinking mechanisms

## Performance Investigation Framework

### Benchmarking Methodology

#### Micro-benchmarks
```go
func BenchmarkRequestParsing(b *testing.B) {
    input := "GET /hello HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n"
    reader := strings.NewReader(input)
    
    b.ResetTimer()
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        reader.Seek(0, 0) // Reset reader
        parseRequest(reader)
    }
}
```

#### Load Testing
```bash
# Use wrk for HTTP load testing
wrk -t12 -c400 -d30s http://localhost:4221/

# Use ab (Apache Bench)
ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://localhost:4221/
```

### Profiling Techniques

#### CPU Profiling
```go
import _ "net/http/pprof"

go func() {
    log.Println(http.ListenAndServe("localhost:6060", nil))
}()
```

#### Memory Profiling
```bash
# Collect heap profile
go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap

# Analyze allocations
go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/allocs
```

## Balancing Focus and Exploration

### Focus Maintenance Strategies

#### Time Boxing
- Set clear start and end times for research
- Use pomodoro technique (25 minutes focused research)
- Regular check-ins: "How does this help my current task?"

#### Relevance Testing
Before diving deep, ask:
- Does this directly improve my current implementation?
- Will this knowledge be useful for the next milestone?
- Can I apply this learning immediately?

#### Progressive Learning
- Start with immediate needs
- Build foundation knowledge gradually
- Save advanced topics for later phases

### When to Stop and Refocus
- When research takes longer than implementation
- When findings don't apply to current challenges
- When you're more than 2 abstraction levels deep

### Creating Learning Momentum
1. **Start Small**: 15-minute focused explorations
2. **Apply Immediately**: Use learnings in current code
3. **Share Knowledge**: Explain findings to solidify understanding
4. **Build Incrementally**: Each session builds on previous knowledge

Remember: The goal is to become a better Go developer while successfully completing your HTTP server. Research should enhance, not replace, hands-on implementation experience.
